# Character Card Builder
Character Card Builder is a demo for the [koog](https://github.com/JetBrains/koog) framework to build AI agents with Kotlin.
The tool uses a local Ollama instance to build character cards that can be used in role-play chat systems like [Silly Tavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern).
