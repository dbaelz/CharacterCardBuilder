# Character Card Builder
Character Card Builder is a demo for the [koog](https://github.com/JetBrains/koog) framework to build AI agents with Kotlin.
The tool uses a local Ollama instance to build character cards that can be used in role-play chat systems like [Silly Tavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern).

## How to use
1. Run the application
2. Add the name or a description of the character as one argument in quotes or as multiple arguments

Example argument: `"Ada Lovelace"` or `"Historical character Ada Lovelace"`.
You can also describe the character like `"A fictional character named John Doe. He is a 42 years old software developer who is passionate about AI. 170 cm height, brown hair and blue eyes."`
